# Detect Eye
The Aim of the project is to facilitate a person to navigate within confined spaces(like rooms in houses or hostel) without bumping into common objects like furniture, walls etc. In the application we intend to help people to be able to walk in such places with confidence.

This project was created as part of a I-Stem Hackathon 2018 intiative.
